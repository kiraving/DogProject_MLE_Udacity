## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree!
This project shows how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the resembling dog breed is shown.

## Project Submission

Your submission should consist of the github link to your repository.  Your repository should contain:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.

Please do __NOT__ include any of the project data sets provided in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.
